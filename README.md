# The Wallet Watcher Project
http://walletwatcherapp.herokuapp.com/

Wallet Watcher provides daily expense tracking services on mobile devices. After creating an account with Wallet Watcher, users are able to enter their daily expenses and track expenses by category. The built-in Smart Chart gives users a quick summary of which category they spent the most by day, week, month, etc.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my abilities as a Full-Stack Web Engineer. At the front-end, I built the website with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I chose mongoDB as the database due to its flexible schema and high scalability. At the back-end, the whole application was written in Python and used Flask as the framework. For production, I utilized Salesforce Heroku and Gunicorn to deploy the project.
